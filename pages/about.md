My goal is to create a practical, trustworthy, and open-source resource for
learning how to keep your new digital assets safe. As an Information Security
professional with a background in Computer Science, I also hope to provide
straightforward explanations of security incidents and technical risks while
guiding readers towards better security and peace of mind.

Since these topics take time to learn and I want to make them more
approachable, feel free to email any questions to questions@joeyrideout.com, no
matter how silly or simple they may feel.

This website and related resources are free, and I will not accept donations.
Creating a valuable community resource is its own reward. If you want to
support me please [follow me](https://twitter.com/joey_rideout), be critical
of me, and help me grow to become that resource.

Stay safe out there.

Joey
