As someone who has been passionate about computer security for almost a decade
and will soon be working full-time as an Information Security professional, I
have been fascinated by the rise of cryptocurrencies. These scarce digital
assets introduce a lot of benefits, and a lot of risks.

As someone who used to work at a firm in the Social Media Marketing industry, I
know the benefits of developing content that does nothing but give value to the
community.

Both of the above have motivated me to dedicate my free time to starting this
blog, related social media properties, and side projects in order to position
myself in this space in the future. A unique opportunity has emerged where I
can hopefully provide a lot of value: promoting security awareness in the
emerging cryptocurrency sector.

Because I genuinely want to create a valuable resource for the community, my
content will be open-source and I will not accept donations. Trying to monetize
content introduces a fundamental conflict of interest that is already rampant
in the cryptocurrency space, so I will avoid doing so. Becoming a valuable
resource in a growing community is its own reward, and a lot to ask for in its
own right. If you want to support me: please [follow
me](https://twitter.com/joey_rideout), be critical of me, and help me grow to
become that resource.

Stay safe out there.

Joey
