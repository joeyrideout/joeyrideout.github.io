I've been taking photographs as a hobby for over five years now, and took photography classes in every year of high school. Below are some albums of my favourite subjects from the past few years. All photos found here are low-resolution previews; if you are interested in purchasing full-resolution copies or have inquiries about my work, please [contact me.](/contact/)
