<h2>Side Projects</h2>

The main reason I set this website up is to have a place to discuss and showcase side projects that I will work on in the years to come. Iâ€™m about to start my first year of university studying Computer Science, and will hopefully produce plenty of interesting projects and ideas that I can populate this site with. I currently do not have any notable side projects, but in a way this site is my first side project. To get up and running I had to learn [how to work with the Octopress blogging framework](/blog/2013/07/07/setting-up-octopress-on-github-pages/), and to host it I had to finally learn how to work with GitHub.

<h2>Networking</h2>

The other important reason I have to set up this site is communication. I do not yet know many people in the software industry or in the technology industry in general. The people in tech that I have met, however, have been incredibly interesting and are great contacts to have. I would like to meet more people with similar interests, and this site will be a great way to introduce myself. If you are reading this blog and would like to introduce yourself, feel free to [contact me](/contact/)!

<h2>Photography</h2>

Lastly, I would like to use this site to showcase some of my [photography](/photography/). I have been taking photos as a hobby for roughly five years now, and would like a public place to share (and possibly sell) my work. Please [have a look](/photography), and [contact me](/contact/) if you are interested in purchasing full-resolution versions of my images.
