title: Cryptocurrency has Reincentivized Cybercrime
tags: [Industry Insight, Economics]

Think about getting mugged on the sidewalk with an empty wallet, which the
mugger simply takes and runs away with. No cash. Your credit cards, ID, and
loyalty cards get stolen. Assuming that no physical or lasting emotional harm
has been done, is it the end of the world? Each of these items can be cancelled
or replaced. You lose time cancelling and replacing them, sure, and you'll have
to spend some money replacing your leather bi-fold, but your life is not ruined.
No wonder the average user is apathetic about security. Their wallets are
empty.

This "empty wallet" scenario has been the norm in cybercrime until now, and
people have been <i>appropriately</i> apathetic. If breaches are so common, and stolen
data has no tangible impact on your life outside of the vague risk of identity
theft, why bother spending time on a good password? Just keep an eye on your
credit card statement and move on. This sentiment is familiar to many
Information Security professionals. Security awareness feels forced; we have to
talk people into caring about the risks, which often ends up sounding a lot like
scare-mongering. "Password reuse is incredibly risky", we say. "Hackers are out
to get you", we say. Why is it so hard to get people to listen? If I'm honest,
the only impact from lack of security awareness I see in my immediate friend
group is the occasional Facebook post: "My account got hacked, don't open
messages you got from me." What's the big deal?

There is a large disconnect between Information Security professionals and the
average user about how big of a deal security is. This disconnect continues
into the workplace, where data breaches are a more realistic threat but users
remain apathetic. What's missing? Maybe users simply don't value their data
enough to protect it. Maybe when the trite response of, "I have nothing to
hide" is rolled out, what is really meant is "if I lose this data it won't cost
me anything". Instead of rolling out yet another refutation by counterexample
of the "I have nothing to hide" argument, we should simply listen to users:
they are telling us that their data isn't very valuable. And, if I'm honest,
there is truth in that message. All they have is an empty wallet.

In economic terms, the currency of stolen user data in general has experienced
high inflation in the last decade. Criminals can only make so much money
stealing information from empty wallets. An oversupply has driven down the
marginal cost of leaked records and login information on the dark web. End
users may have grown even more apathetic to further breaches because they
figure that their data is already out there. This apathy has caused security
professionals to grow increasingly frustrated as the perceived value of
security solutions decrease.

This trend is about to reverse completely, for one reason: digital currency is
worth more than personally identifiable information. Information Security
professionals are in the business of protecting digital assets, and digital
money has just been invented. Let that sink in for a moment.

The game has changed. Now there is cash for our proverbial mugger to
steal. Tangible loss of scarce, irreplaceable digital assets is now a real
risk. Fraud detection systems do not exist to monitor transactions; consumers
are not protected, so criminals are not hindered. Gone are the days of selling
batches of thousands of stolen credit card numbers for pennies on the dollar
because they are so hard to actually use; digital coins are easy to launder
thanks to unregulated exchanges and privacy-centric coins like Monero.
Cryptocurrency-funded ransomware is already the norm. Viruses are now more
profitable because the host machine's computing resources can mine
cryptocurrency instead of only being used as a network resource for wholesale
DDoS attacks. Phishing scams that used to walk users through convoluted Best
Buy gift card purchases now have a frictionless method for being sent money. The
incentive structure for cybercrime is changing, and it's changing quickly.

Thanks to cryptocurrencies, the stakes for cybercrime for end users have
increased dramatically: fail to protect your wallet, and thieves will empty it
immediately before laundering it at market value through a privacy coin. There
is no number you can call to cancel the transaction that emptied your wallet,
and no authority you can call to replace the stolen goods.

As a result, apathy for security in the cryptocurrency community is practically
nonexistent. Everyone with a digital wallet seems concerned about keeping it
safe. This scenario is a novelty for security professionals: the average user
genuinely cares about their security now. Why? Because, for the first time,
their money is directly on the line; their wallets are no longer empty. For the
first time, security awareness is seeing an <i>organic growth in demand from end
users</i>. This rise in demand makes sense, since far more than personally
identifiable information is at stake. <b>I have yet to hear someone say "I have
nothing to hide" when discussing the security of their cryptocurrency wallet.</b>
This organic demand for security awareness will only increase with adoption.
Anecdotally, I have already had friends seek my advice regarding the security
of digital currency that they own or hope to buy. Never in my entire life have
my friends proactively asked me for security advice in a non-professional
setting before cryptocurrency enterred the scene. 

We shouldn't underestimate the impact of this paradigm shift on the Information
Security industry. The internet is often referred to as a Wild West by security
professionals, but it was missing something: digital bank robberies. Bonnie and
Clyde. Only now that there is digital cash to steal are we in a real Wild West.
The incentives have made it so.






Yes, stealing money via cybercrime has been possible for
some time, but the margins were much slimmer. Stolen credit cards have fraud detection
systems tracking each transaction, and cards can be frozen automatically or
cancelled with a phone call if a theft is detected. Laundering stolen credit is
difficult, expensive, and risky as well: one careless purchase and the merchant
will have law enforcement waiting for you in the parking lot. Wire fraud and
online banking hacks are similarly difficult, requiring technical skill and
evasion of fraud detection systems as well as a "hot" bank account where funds
can eventually be liquidated. Cash withdrawn in this manner is trackable via
serial numbers, and those hot bank accounts are easily disabled. In short,
digital heists pre-cryptocurrency were economically impractical. It got to the
point where scammers spent their time convincing people to buy BestBuy gift
cards in order to send them money. The baddies were really scraping the bottom of the
barrel.

Now, criminals are flocking to cryptocurrencies in droves. Ransomware is on the
rise. Viruses are more profitable because the host machine can mine
cryptocurrency. Systems holding large amounts of digital tokens are juicier
targets than systems holding credit card numbers or passwords; exchange hacks
are occuring at a high rate. Phishing attacks are very straightforward now: no
more convincing people to buy Best Buy gift cards to pay you, just have them
send some Etherium at the click of a button before the sense of panic and
urgency wears off. The baddies moved quickly, and the community is taking
notice.





Highway robbery is now possible on the information superhighway, and we are the
sheriffs who must rise to the occasion to protect weary travelers.

The amount of Social Security Numbers, credit card numbers, and medical records
for sale on the dark web have increased dramatically in recent years. This
oversupply has driven down the cost of each piece of stolen data. The currency
of stolen data has experienced high inflation.The Equifax breach, arguably a
doomsday scenario for identity theft, is hardly talked about anymore. Criminals
are being paid less and less for this data, and we are paying it less and less
attention. Nobody cares. If some of our most highly-protected data is
frequently stolen, why bother spending time and money protecting it? Apathy is
high among end users and corporate executives alike. Budgeting for Information
Security is an annoyingly vague risk analysis task. What’s the cost of someone
stealing my username and password?

Not much. At least, that’s the perception of the average internet user.
Security practitioners are perpetually trying to spread awareness to apathetic
users, but the message often falls on deaf ears. And maybe it should. I can’t
shake the feeling that security professionals oversell the risks involved with
data protection on a daily basis. Every problem is critical, every virus is a
threat, every security department is lacking budget, and every vendor is
selling you the Next Greatest Security Solution. Hackers are out to get you!
Abreach will cost your company millions! Have we become sophists, shilling our
wares by leveraging fear in those who trust our expertise?

The Information Security industry has thus become inflated on both sides of the
demand curve: professionals are overselling the risks, and criminals are paying
less for the goods. The currency of stolen data has been devalued.

I predict that with the advent of cryptocurrencies, we are now entering a
period of rapid deflation. Remote access trojans used to be used for creating
botnets for inexpensive denial of service attacks; now they can leverage stolen
computer resources at maximum load, 24/7, to mine cryptocurrencies. Stolen bank
account balances used to be sold for pennies on the dollar because laundering
is prohibitively risky and expensive for thieves; stolen cryptocurrencies can
be laundered perfectly at market value with decentralized atomic swaps for
privacy coins like Monero. Private key infrastructure used to be deployed and
carefully guarded by system administrators simply because they secure SSL keys
and employee emails; now public key infrastructure will secure wallets, cash
flow, tangible asset deeds, and securities. In each of the cases above, the
latter is orders of magnitudes more valuable than the former. Data will be much
more valuable to criminals and worth protecting for companies. Deflation!

Some have said that 2018 will be the year of tokenized securities exchanges. We
will be able to buy and sell shares, bonds, or options in a decentralized
manner without a central brokerage or stock exchange. Think about what doors
that will open for cybercriminals. We hear about data breaches all the time;
usernames and passwords have been stolen… again. Yawn. When’s the last time you
heard of a hedge fund collapsing because an anonymous intruder liquidated all
of their holdings overnight and sold them instantly for market value in Monero
before disappearing like a ghost? Or a senior citizen’s retirement fund being
liquidated anonymously overnight because they left their computer unlocked in
the nursing home? Or a corporate executive insider trading through a private
token exchange in such a way that the trade can never be traced back to them?
We are opening Pandora's Box here.

As the value of data and scarce digital assets rapidly deflate, we are running
headlong into a golden age of cybercrime. Frictionless decentralized token
theft and anonymous laundering, coupled with a lack of fraud detection and
regulatory firms overseeing transactions, will lead to a boom in cybercrime. We
are also racing towards a world where risk analysis in Information Security
will become incredibly tangible for once. A compromised endpoint will cost as
much as the tokens it controls and whatever its data can be ransomed for. Smart
contracts will provide guarantees of decryption on payment, so this new dark
economy will be efficient as well. The Information Security industry will need
to put our money where our mouth is. Our current sophistical salesmanship will
quickly be uprooted by an authentic demand to protect digital currency and
other scarce digital assets.

Buckle up.
