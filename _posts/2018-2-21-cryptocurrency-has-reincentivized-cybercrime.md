title: Cryptocurrency has Reincentivized Cybercrime

Think about getting mugged on the sidewalk with only an empty wallet on your
person, which the mugger simply takes and runs away with. No cash. Your credit
cards, ID, and loyalty cards get stolen. Assuming that no physical or lasting
emotional harm has been done, is it the end of the world? Each of these items
can be cancelled or replaced. You lose time cancelling and replacing them,
sure, and you'll have to spend some money replacing some of the cards along
with your fancy RFID-blocking bifold, but your life is far from ruined. No
wonder the average user is apathetic about security: on the web, their wallets
are empty. Some data, but no cash.

Privacy is a concern, of course, but more people care about money. Or rather,
people are directly incentivized to care about money. Since money was not
directly involved in this proverbial empty wallet of personal data, people were
not directly incentivized to protect it. I am speculating on user motives here,
but "lack of incentive" encapsulates the average user response to security
initiatives pretty well. At the very least, users who aren't privacy-centric
<i>act</i> as if they have no compelling incentive to be proactive with
security.

Users are easier to understand if you look at bad security habits as an
incentive issue. If breaches are so common, and stolen data has no tangible
impact on your life outside of the vague risk of identity theft, why bother
spending time on a good password? Just keep an eye on your credit card
statement and move on. This sentiment is familiar to many Information Security
professionals who aim to promote security among end users. Security awareness
feels forced; we have to talk people into caring about the risks, which often
ends up sounding a lot like scare-mongering. "Password reuse is incredibly
risky", we say. "Hackers are out to get you", we say. Why is it so hard to get
people to listen? If I'm honest, maybe it's because following security advice
often takes more effort than it's worth. The only impact I see from a lack of
security awareness in my friend group is the occasional Facebook post saying,
"my account got hacked, don't open messages you got from me". So what's the big
deal?

Herein lies some cognitive dissonance: there is a large disconnect between
Information Security professionals and the average user about the importance of
security. This disconnect continues into the workplace. Data breaches and
compliance are realistic concerns for corporate executives, so they are
incentivized to budget for security to reduce the risk. Most corporate security
awareness initiatives simply try to align the incentives of employees with the
incentives of those executives. Outside of those programs, users remain
apathetic. What's missing?  Maybe users just don't value their own data
enough to protect it. Maybe when the trite response of "I have nothing to hide"
is rolled out, what a user really means is "if I lose this data it won't cost
me very much". Instead of rolling out yet another refutation by counterexample
of the "I have nothing to hide" argument taken at face value, maybe the
Information Security industry should simply listen to the users: they are
telling us that their personal data isn't very valuable. And, if I'm honest,
there is truth in that message. All they have is an empty wallet. A recent
behavioural shift in cybercrime tells me that criminals agree with this
valuation, too.

In economic terms, the currency of stolen user data has experienced high
inflation in the decade prior to cryptocurrency becoming popular. Criminals can
only make so much money stealing information from empty wallets. An oversupply
has driven down the marginal cost of leaked records and login information on
the dark web. End users may have grown even more apathetic to future breaches
because they figure that their data is already out there. This apathy has
caused security professionals to grow increasingly frustrated as the perceived
value of security solutions decrease. Stolen data has dropped in value from
both the supply side and the demand side.

<b>This trend is about to reverse completely, for one reason: digital currency is
worth more than personally identifiable information.</b>

Information Security professionals are in the business of protecting digital
assets, and digital money has just been invented. Let that sink in for a
moment.

The game has changed. Now there is cash for our proverbial mugger to steal.
Tangible loss of scarce, irreplaceable digital assets is now a real risk for
individual users. Fraud detection systems do not yet exist to monitor these
transactions; consumers are not protected, and criminals are not hindered. Gone
are the days of selling batches of thousands of stolen credit card numbers for
pennies on the dollar because they are so hard to actually use; digital coins
are easy to launder thanks to unregulated (and soon, decentralized) exchanges
and privacy-centric coins like Monero. Cryptocurrency-funded ransomware is
already the norm. Viruses are now more profitable because the host machine's
computing resources can mine cryptocurrency instead of only being used as a
network resource for wholesale DDoS attacks. Phishing scams that used to walk
users through convoluted Best Buy gift card purchases now have a frictionless
method for being sent money. See a trend? The incentive structure for cybercrime is
changing, and it's changing quickly.

Thanks to cryptocurrencies, the stakes for falling victim to cybercrime have
increased dramatically for end users: fail to protect your wallet, and thieves
will empty it immediately before laundering its contents at market value
through a privacy coin. Game over. There is no number you can call to cancel
the transaction that emptied your wallet, and no authority you can call to
replace the stolen goods.

As a result, apathy for security in the cryptocurrency community is practically
nonexistent. Everyone with a digital wallet seems appropriately concerned about
keeping it safe. This scenario is a novelty for Information Security
professionals: the average user genuinely cares about their security now. Why?
Because, for the first time, their money is directly on the line; their wallets
are no longer empty. For the first time, security awareness is seeing an
<i>organic growth in demand from end users</i>. This rise in demand makes
sense, since more than just personally identifiable information is at stake.
<b>I have yet to hear someone say "I have nothing to hide" when discussing the
security of their cryptocurrency wallet.</b> This organic demand for security
awareness will only increase with adoption. Anecdotally, I have already had
friends seek my advice regarding the security of digital currency that they own
or hope to buy. Never in my entire life have my friends proactively asked me
for security advice in a non-professional setting before cryptocurrency
enterred the scene. 

We shouldn't underestimate the impact of this paradigm shift on the Information
Security industry. The internet is often referred to as a Wild West by security
professionals, but it was missing something: digital bank robberies. Butch
Cassidy. Now that there is digital cash to steal, we are truly in a Wild
West. The incentives have made it so.
