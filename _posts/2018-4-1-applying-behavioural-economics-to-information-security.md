Based on my own anecdotal view of the Information Security product
market, I may ask the following question: has the emergence of quantum
computing as a perceived threat created a "bubble" of quantum-resistant
solutions (an oversupply) based on speculative demand?

In financial markets, the phrase *irrational exuberance* is often used to
describe the psychology of such mania, but I would use a different phrase to
describe similar trends in Information Security: *irrational anxiety*. If no
real quantum threats exist yet, then the *fundamentals* of the underlying risk
being mitigated may be shakey, and the value of quantum-safe solutions being
sold may be described as *speculative* in nature. Of course, like many bubbles,
the underlying trend has some truth to it: quantum computers of the future are
an important future threat, and we must begin planning for a post-quantum
world. But is the current "boom" a result of careful planning for real risks,
or something else entirely?

An important aspect of behavioural economics is the idea of how the news media
and investor sentiment form a feedback loop. Shiller's iconic novel "Irrational
Exuberance" discusses the possibility of an "attention cascade" when new
information is made available to the investing public. Something scary, like
the possibility of a market crash, is slowly introduced to the public from
something like an opinion piece in a newspaper. Then, the idea snowballs into a
couple more newspaper articles, then some more, then suddenly everyone is
talking about it, until the panic causes it to become true. Does the same
phenomenon occur in Information Security?

Conference talk topics may be one reasonable indicator of what the Information
Security community is discussing at a given point in time. If we scrape talk
schedules from reputable security conferences year by year, and extract the
keyword "quantum" from them, we get the following:



Another example of this social dissemination in the Information Security
industry is the release of high-profile exploits with brandnames and landing
pages. Heartbleed, Krack, ShellShock, the list goes on. They typically make the
internet equivalent of "front-page news", at least in the security community.

It remains to be studied whether or not such phenomena can be
fairly attributed to the Information Security industry, but I think that the
comparison is a worthwhile one. In any case, applying economic theories to trends
in Information Security will be an interesting endeavor.
