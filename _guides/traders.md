Note: This guide is basically a condensed version of the <a
href="/device-security/">Device Security</a>, <a href="/coin-storage/">Coin
Storage</a>, <a href="coin-movement">Coin Movement</a>, and <a
href="/passwords/">Password</a> guides, with an emphasis on exchanges and
trading activity. Some market analogies and puns are thrown in for good
measure, too :)
