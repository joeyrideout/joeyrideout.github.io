        <p>Two days ago, at 4:30pm, I walked out of residence with my friend and we headed towards the 2014 Facebook Hackathon at the University of Waterloo. I went in with an open mind, expecting to get to work immediately and write code for twenty-four hours straight.</p>

<p>It was not what I expected.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I mean, we did code as much as possible for twenty-four hours, but the Facebook Hackathon was much more than that. I had underestimated the learning potential of getting over two hundred hackers and one deadline under one roof. I had also underestimated the atmosphere and camaraderie generated by getting so many people to pull an all-nighter together. Mix in some very friendly and experienced Facebook employees, a pile of food, caffeine, and raffle prizes, and you have an amazing time.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after entering the building, a pair of hackers called over my friend and I and offered to form a team of four. Awesome. These two were more experienced than my friend and I, but we were willing to learn. And that’s sure what we did. We began work on a secure, browser-based video chatting web application called SoundProof. The idea was to set up a secure, “sound proof” communication tunnel between people on the web. It was a cool and interesting idea, but an incredibly difficult one that would require us learning quite a few new technologies.</p>

<p>Thus begins the story of how I became acquainted with Ruby on Rails, Foundation, Javascript, Node.js, HTML5, Firebase, and WebRTC in less than 24 hours.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails was the platform of choice for our web app, with a Foundation CSS responsive front-end design. As the Rails hacker on our team got to work, I learned enough about Rails so that I could contribute some front-end design work with the easier-to-learn Foundation. We set up a GitHub repository and an instance of our work-in-progress app on Heroku, and got to work. Looming over us, however, was this standard called WebRTC that was required to make plugin-free, browser-based video communication possible. After finishing some preliminary design work, I dug in to WebRTC.</p>

<p>WebRTC is complex. It uses something called a signalling server to coordinate a communication between two clients, passing on information such as IP addresses and NAT configurations. Those configurations would then be used to set up WebSockets between the two client browsers. Then, an audio-video stream is taken from each client’s webcam using the magic of HTML5 and a function called getUserMedia(), which would then interface with WebRTC and stream data in real time.</p>

<p>Getting this working would require me learning a bit of HTML5 and some Javascript, so I did. Then I found some example WebRTC implementations and started hacking together something that would (hopefully) work out of the box with our Rails app. I managed to get the client-side aspect working, generating and displaying the client’s webcam stream back to that client. Now we had to, for lack of a better phrase, cross the streams!</p>

<p>To connect two clients, we had to either have our Rails web-app act as the signalling server or figure out how to coordinate with a pre-existing, third-party signalling server. We were stuck, and called a Facebook engineer over to help. (That last sentence, by the way, was one of the reasons this hackathon was truly great.)  He suggested ditching Rails and using Node.js, because apparently Node can handle real time communication where Rails cannot. He also noted, rather accurately, that “doing video is hard”. In hindsight I think we should have continued working with Rails anyway, because WebRTC establishes real time communication between two clients and not the server. But, at 6am, we decided to start learning Node.</p>

<p>Long story short, we did not make much more progress with our app. We ended up adding text chat room functionality via Firebase, but could not get WebRTC working correctly in what time we had left. So we crafted a nice two-minute pitch of what we built to the panel of Facebook engineers at the end of the hackathon, and called it a day. Some hackers in the room managed to put together some incredible apps, and the long list of over forty groups who presented was quite impressive.</p>

<p>I learned a lot, and will be coming back for more next year. In order to bring my A-game next time, I have some reading to do.</p>
