        <p>“Why do you love Computer Science? Why do you love Math?”</p>

<p>As a Computer Science major, I get asked these questions all the time. I’ve come to the conclusion, however, that these two questions answer each other.</p>

<p>My high school did not have any Computer Science classes, but it had one heck of an honours Math program. This Math program squished grade 9 and 10 Math into our grade 9 year, in order to put us a year ahead and give us room for AP Calculus in our senior year.  It also put us in a classroom with the best Math teachers in our school (and arguably, the entire school district) along with an entire class of like-minded Mathies. This supportive and encouraging learning environment was very motivational, and I had always been “good at Math”, so I jumped right in.</p>

<p>Clever classmates and talented teachers were wonderful, but what really got me hooked on that Math class came as somewhat of a surprise – Computer Science.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My school’s lack of CS classes was not a hindrance; it merely forced me to cure my natural curiosity with computers outside of class. This self-motivated learning was, arguably, much better for me. I found myself indulging in fascinating topics that would normally never be taught at all in high school. Web development, cryptography, and information security were particularly fascinating to me.  What was more fascinating, though, was how learning about CS changed my opinion of Math.</p>

<p>It became fun.</p>

<p>My prior opinion of Math was that it is, if you’ll forgive the term, a chore. My classmates and I were always fighting against functions and banging our heads against our calculators until a number popped out that we could write down. Many uphill battles were being fought as we constantly tried to tame variables in order to get the grades we needed and move on. Although the concepts were intriguing and getting the correct answer was satisfying, something was missing.</p>

<p>And then I learned how to code.</p>

<p>Variables became alarmingly useful constructs, and functions suddenly had a practical purpose. Everything I had learned in Math became applicable. Even Calculus became a wonderful thing, now that I knew it had badass applications such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography.</p>

<p>Learning to code made Math work for me, not against me.</p>

<p>Now I wonder how much more fun Math would have been for me if I had learned to code earlier. If my school taught Computer Science, or if I had learned to code in middle school, I would have discovered this passion for Math and CS much earlier. I can only wonder how many other students could have exceled in Math at a much earlier age if they had been introduced to Computer Science.</p>

<p>Computer Science should be taught alongside Math in school, because it is capable of giving students a love of both. Of course Math and CS aren’t for everyone, but no subject taught in school really is. But then again, learning about Computer Science has the added benefit of giving students technical skills that they will use for the rest of their lives, so it’s a win-win. That works for me.</p>
